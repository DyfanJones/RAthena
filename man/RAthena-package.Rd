\title{RAthena: a DBI interface into Athena using Boto3 SDK}
\description{
RAthena provides a seamless DBI interface into Athena using the python package 
\href{https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html}{Boto3}.
}
\section{Goal of Package}{

The goal of the \code{RAthena} package is to provide a DBI-compliant interface to \href{https://aws.amazon.com/athena/}{Amazonâ€™s Athena}
using \code{Boto3} software development kit (SDK). This allows for an efficient, easy setup connection to Athena using the \code{Boto3} SDK as a driver.
}

\section{Installation}{

Before starting with \code{RAthena}, \href{https://www.python.org/}{Python} is require to be installed on the machine you are intending to run \code{RAthena}.
}

\section{AWS Command Line Interface}{

As RAthena is using \code{Boto3} as it's backend, \href{https://aws.amazon.com/cli/}{AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)} can be used
to remove user credentials when interacting with Athena.

This allows AWS profile names to be set up so that RAthena can connect to different accounts from the same machine,
without needing hard code any credentials.
